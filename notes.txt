# More images per batch -> better feature recognition
# More batches -> better reduction in noise and more accurate phase amplitude


# Use a learning rate of approximately 1e-4 for AdamOptimizer, or 0.5 for
GradienDescentOptimizer

# Using three images as input data increases edge contrast relative to using two.
# This may simply be a result of the additional connections between the input and
# first hidden layer. Test this theory by using two images, but increasing the
# number of neurons in the hidden layer by 50%.
